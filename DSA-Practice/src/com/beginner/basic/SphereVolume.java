Problem Description

You are given a positive integer A denoting the radius of a sphere. You have to calculate the volume of the sphere.

Volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * Ï€ * R3) / 3.

NOTE: Since, the answer can be a real number, you have to return the ceil value of the volume. Ceil value of a real number X is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to X.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 400



Input Format

First and only argument is an integer A.



Output Format

Return a single integer denoting the ceil value of volume of the sphere.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 1
Input 2:

 A = 4


Example Output

Output 1:

 5
Output 2:

 269


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Volume of sphere having radius 1 units = 4.19
 Ceil value of volume = 5
Explanation 2:

 Volume of sphere having radius 4 units = 268.08
 Ceil value of volume = 269
