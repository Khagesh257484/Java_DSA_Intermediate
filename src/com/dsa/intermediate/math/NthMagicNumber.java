Problem Description
Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.

A magic number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a power of 5 or a sum of unique powers of 5.

First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 5000



Input Format
The only argument given is integer A.



Output Format
Return the Ath magic number.



Example Input
Example Input 1:

 A = 3
Example Input 2:

 A = 10


Example Output
Example Output 1:

 30
Example Output 2:

 650


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Magic Numbers in increasing order are [5, 25, 30, 125, 130, ...]
 3rd element in this is 30
Explanation 2:

 In the sequence shown in explanation 1, 10th element will be 650.

(Taking Binary of number 1,2 ,3,4 & Multiplying with power same as we do in binary with base 2)
Here base is 5

 A=1(001) : 5^1 = 5
 A=2(010) : 5^2 = 25
 A=3(011) : 5^1+5^2=30
 A=4(100) : 5^3 = 125

 So from here we can find binary of number with base 5
