Question : Given an array of integers A and multiple values in B, which represents the number of times array A needs to be left rotated.
Find the rotated array for each value and return the result in the from of a matrix where ith row represents the rotated array for the ith value in B.

Input : A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        B = [2, 3]

Output : [ [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
         [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] ]

Explanation : Have to rotate element from right to left & after each rotation have to print it in 2d array format
