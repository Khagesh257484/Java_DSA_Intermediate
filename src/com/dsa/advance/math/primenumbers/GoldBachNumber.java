  1) As we know that if we add 2 odd number than sum will be even of both numbers. 11+13=24, 27+21=48
      And you can observe that there is no even prime number except 2 in number theory.

  GoldBach Number : A Goldbach number is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.
                    Since four is the only even number greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the
                    sum of two primes, but 2 is even prime & we need odd prime.

               ->   Another form of the statement of Goldbachâ€™s conjecture is that all even integers greater than
                    4 are Goldbach numbers.
